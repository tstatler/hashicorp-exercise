## Comparing git push, pull, and fetch commands

You use the `git push,` `git fetch,` and `git pull` commands to synchronize changes between local and remote repositories.

- [`git push`](#git-push) - Uploads changes from your local branch to the remote branch.
- [`git fetch`](#git-fetch) â€” Retrieves changes from the remote branch into the remote-tracking branch without merging them into your local branch.
- [`git pull`](#git-pull) - Retrieves changes from the remote branch into the remote-tracking branch and merges them into your local branch.

### Git push

The `git push` command first checks that there is a remote-tracking branch for the remote repository connected to your local branch. If so, it synchronizes your local changes with the remote branch. In other words, this operation makes the remote branch identical to your local branch.  If not all commits in the remote branch are in your local branch, the remote will reject the push operation, as shown below:

```bash
git push
To https://github.com/example/example.git
! [rejected]        feature-branch -> feature-branch
```

In this case, you need to first synchronize your branch with the remote branch by either running `git pull` or `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. See [`git pull`](#git-pull) and [`git fetch`](#git-fetch) for details on each approach.

### Git fetch

The `git fetch` command updates your remote-tracking branch with changes from the remote branch but does not merge those changes into your local branch. This allows you to review the incoming changes before updating your working branch. It first checks for a corresponding remote-tracking branch (`origin/main,` for example). If one exists, it updates the tracking branch with the changes from the remote branch.

```bash
git fetch
...
From https://github.com/example/example-repo
   cc57037..f91adc6  main       -> origin/main
```

Assuming you had the `main` branch checked out locally and `origin` was the remote name, you would run the following command to merge the fetched changes:

```bash
git merge origin/main
```

If you don't need or want to review remote changes before merging, you can use the [`git pull`](#git-pull) command, which combines `git fetch` and `git merge` in a single operation.

### Git pull

The `git pull` command calls [`git fetch`](#git-fetch) followed immediately by [`git merge`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge). This is often the desired result when working collaboratively; however, some developers may prefer to call `git fetch` to make sure they understand the incoming changes before merging them with `git merge.`
